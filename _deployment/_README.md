# For a quick deployment

Install this app in your project

**settings.py**
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    '_deployment',
]
```

- Copy the content of 'COPY_TO_ROOT' into the root directory of your project.
- Make a .env file from the .env-sample and ADD IT TO your .gitignore

You're good to go now.
