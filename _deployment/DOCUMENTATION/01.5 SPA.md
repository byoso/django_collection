# Frontend

If you're using a SPA, don't forget to redirect the backend url to the actual production server.

Example: in my case, a vue.js app with axios.

**main.js**
```js
// ...
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://www.example.com'
// ...

```

Then compile a build of the frontend app.


# NGINX config (ssl)

The config file should look like this.

**default-ssl.conf.tpl**
```sh
# ...
# statics and medias are the same
 location /static {
        alias /vol/static/static;
    }

    location /media {
        alias /vol/static/media;
    }

# each app must have its own route, they can have the same settings
    location /admin {
        uwsgi_pass                  ${APP_HOST}:${APP_PORT};
        include                     /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params;
        client_max_body_size        ${MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE}M;
    }

    location /app1 {
        uwsgi_pass                  ${APP_HOST}:${APP_PORT};
        include                     /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params;
        client_max_body_size        ${MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE}M;
    }

    location /app2 {
        uwsgi_pass                  ${APP_HOST}:${APP_PORT};
        include                     /etc/nginx/uwsgi_params;
        client_max_body_size        ${MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE}M;
    }

# serves index.html at /, assuming this file is in static/dist/
    location / {
        root /vol/static/static/dist;
        index index.html;
```
